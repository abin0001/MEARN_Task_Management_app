- **Login:** Users can log in to their account.
- **Profile Management:** Users can update their profile information.

#### Task Management

- **Create Tasks:** Users can create new tasks with a title, description, and due date.
- **Edit Tasks:** Users can edit existing tasks.
- **Delete Tasks:** Users can delete tasks.
- **View Tasks:** Users can view a list of their tasks, organized by categories or due dates.

#### Task Organization

- **Categorization:** Users can categorize tasks (e.g., work, personal, urgent).
- **Priority Levels:** Users can set priority levels for tasks (e.g., high, medium, low).
- **Deadlines:** Users can set and update deadlines for tasks.
- **Reminders:** Users can set reminders for upcoming deadlines.

#### Collaboration

- **Charts and Graphs:** Visual representations of task completion rates and deadlines.

### Development Steps

1. **Set Up Project**

   - Initialize a Git repository for version control.
   - Set up the frontend using Vue.js or React.js.
   - Set up the backend using Node.js with Express.
   - Configure the database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL).

2. **Frontend Development**

   - **User Interface:** Design and develop the user interface for login, signup, task management, and dashboard.
   - **State Management:** Use a state management library (e.g., Redux for React, Vuex for Vue) to manage application state.
   - **API Integration:** Integrate frontend with backend APIs for user authentication and task management.

3. **Backend Development**

   - **API Endpoints:** Develop RESTful API endpoints for user authentication, task management, and collaboration features.
   - **Database Models:** Create database models for users, tasks, and teams.
   - **Authentication:** Implement JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication for secure login and signup.
   - **Error Handling:** Implement error handling and validation for API requests.

4. **Testing**

   - **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests for frontend and backend components.
   - **Integration Testing:** Ensure that the frontend and backend work together seamlessly.
   - **End-to-End Testing:** Simulate user interactions to test the entire application flow.

5. **Deployment**
   - **Frontend:** Deploy the frontend to a hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
   - **Backend:** Deploy the backend to a cloud service (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
   - **Database:** Set up the database on a cloud service (e.g., MongoDB Atlas, AWS RDS).

### Additional Enhancements

- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Ensure the app is mobile-friendly.
- **Dark Mode:** Add a dark mode option for the user interface.
- **Notifications:** Implement email or push notifications for task reminders.
- **Progress Tracking:** Add features to track the progress of tasks over time.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
